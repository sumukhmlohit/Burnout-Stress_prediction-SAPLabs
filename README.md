# Burnout-Stress_prediction-SAPLabs
The objective of the project is to predict the burnout rate and stress score real-time. The project consists of 2 parts:- one where the burnout rate of an employee is predicted and the other where stress level of the employee is predicted with the video of his face. The burnout rate prediction application uses features like mental fatigue score, Work from home setup, working hours, gender and type of company using Keras neural networks. The stress detection application uses  features like facial expression, lip and eyebrows movement to calculate stress score real time using OpenCV. In the future, the mental fatigue/stress score obtained can be used to input to the burnout rate prediction model.
